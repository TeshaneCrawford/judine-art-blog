      <p>
        Judine Fiddler is a Jamaican-born artist currently based in New York. With an undergraduate 
        degree from New York University, where she studied both Psychology and Studio Art, Fiddler 
        brings a unique perspective to her work. Her artistic mediums include acrylic paint, 
        watercolors, and charcoal on paper or canvas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fiddler's work primarily portrays black figures, sourced from real life, images, and 
        imagination. Her figurative portraits and mixed media paintings are influenced by abstract 
        expressionism and incorporate her knowledge of psychology and human behavior to capture 
        emotional conflict and resilience.
      </p>

      Fiddler frequently draws inspiration from her own memories and childhood experiences to reflect 
      the vagaries of time and recollection. Her paintings often feature a range of settings including 
      landscapes and architecture that suggest both cohesion and chaos. Her artistic style is reflective
      of the complexity and richness of human emotions and experiences, making her work 
      thought-provoking and impactful.
